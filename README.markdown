CLI interaction simulator
=========================

Simulates user interaction with a shell and stores both the command strings
themselves and their output (both STDOUT and STDERR) to files.

Usage
------------------
1. Create stuff in scripts/ (a ready-to-run example is already there)
2. `./generate.bash`

Disclaimer
------------------
I take no responsibility for this program should it cause any harm.
